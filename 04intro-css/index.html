        <h1>Why Tank size matters</h1>
        <h2>Room to grow</h2>

        <p>Imagine living in a one-bedroom apartment with three other roommates. That’s a tight squeeze—especially if
            the room is only 10 by 10 feet. Even living alone in such a small space would feel cramped. Most of us would
            want to get out whenever we could. As autonomous beings, we can remove ourselves from uncomfortable
            situations. But your aquatic friend doesn’t have that option.

            Your fish depends entirely on you for its comfort and well-being. Responsible care includes providing a
            properly sized aquarium, ensuring compatible tank mates, maintaining the right water parameters, and
            offering a balanced diet. Creating the right environment helps your aquatic companion live a healthy,
            stress-free life.</p>
        <p>Caring for your aquatic pet involves more than feeding—it also means thoughtfully furnishing their habitat.
            Some fish thrive in environments with abundant live plants, which can provide oxygen, shelter, and natural
            stimulation. Others may do just as well with artificial plants, though it's important to choose soft,
            fish-safe materials to avoid damaging delicate fins or tails. In some cases, fish that like to dig or
            rearrange their surroundings may uproot live plants, making hardscape decorations or anchored faux plants a
            more practical choice.</p>

        <h2>Roommate compatibility </h2>
        <p>When setting up an aquarium, it's important to consider more than just the size of the tank—you must also
            carefully evaluate the compatibility of potential tank mates. Some fish species are naturally aggressive and
            require specific companions to avoid conflict, or may need to be housed alone altogether. Peaceful species,
            on the other hand, generally coexist well with a wide range of fish, but even then, size matters. A peaceful
            fish may still view much smaller tank mates as food. Additionally, schooling fish often thrive in groups of
            their own kind, but can become territorial or exhibit bullying behavior toward other species. Ultimately,
            the types of fish you choose will determine both the appropriate tank size and which other species can
            safely and harmoniously share the space.</p>
